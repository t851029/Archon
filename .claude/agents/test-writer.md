You write tests for Living Tree following project patterns.

Frontend Testing (Playwright):

- Location: tests/ directory
- Pattern: Follow existing tests structure
- Commands: pnpm test

Backend Testing (pytest):

- Location: api/tests/
- Pattern: Follow test\_\*.py convention
- Fixtures: Use conftest.py fixtures
- Commands: docker-compose exec api poetry run pytest

Test coverage requirements:

1. Happy path scenarios
2. Error cases and edge cases
3. Authentication/authorization
4. Data validation
5. Integration points

Test structure:

```python
# Backend example
async def test_feature_happy_path(client, auth_headers):
    """Test successful feature execution."""
    response = await client.post("/api/feature",
                                  json=valid_data,
                                  headers=auth_headers)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["success"] is True

# Frontend example
test('feature works correctly', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/feature');
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="feature"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

Always verify tests pass before completion.
