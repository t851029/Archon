# Debug Summary - Living Tree Clerk Rate Limiting Fixes

## Issue

The code review identified that the `useAuthenticatedFetch` hook was created but not integrated into the components, and minor improvements were needed for documentation and testing.

## Root Cause

While the initial fix correctly removed `getToken` from dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops, the components were still using direct fetch calls instead of the new `useAuthenticatedFetch` hook which provides better patterns and automatic rate limit handling.

## Fix

1. **Integrated `useAuthenticatedFetch` hook into both components**:
   - `tools-page-client.tsx`: Now uses the hook for all authenticated API calls
   - `auto-drafts-settings.tsx`: Now uses the hook for settings load and save operations

2. **Enhanced documentation with usage examples**:
   - Added comprehensive examples to `fetchWithRetry` showing basic usage and custom retry counts
   - Added examples to `useAuthenticatedFetch` showing GET and POST requests

3. **Created comprehensive unit tests**:
   - `fetch-utils.test.ts`: Tests retry logic, exponential backoff, and rate limit handling
   - `use-authenticated-fetch.test.tsx`: Tests hook stability, token injection, and error handling

4. **Updated TypeScript configuration**:
   - Excluded test files from compilation to avoid Jest type errors

## Prevention

- Always use the `useAuthenticatedFetch` hook for authenticated API calls
- Follow the documented patterns to avoid dependency array issues
- Run type checking before committing changes
- Consider adding integration tests for the full authentication flow

## Affected Environments

- [x] Local - Improved performance and stability
- [x] Staging - Will resolve rate limiting issues once deployed
- [ ] Production - Changes should be tested in staging first

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Authentication**: All API calls now use the same authentication pattern
2. **Automatic Rate Limit Handling**: The `fetchWithRetry` utility handles 429 errors gracefully
3. **Better Developer Experience**: Clear usage examples and comprehensive tests
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized authentication logic in a reusable hook
5. **No More Infinite Loops**: Proper dependency management prevents re-render cycles

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Configure Clerk staging application with production keys (manual task)
3. Monitor for 24 hours to confirm rate limiting issues are resolved
4. Consider applying pattern to other components that make authenticated requests
