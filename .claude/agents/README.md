# Claude Code Subagents Collection

Specialized AI team members that extend Claude Code's capabilities with task-specific expertise and dedicated context windows.

## üéØ Purpose

Subagents are autonomous AI specialists that Claude Code can invoke automatically to handle specific types of tasks. They provide focused expertise, isolated context, and specialized tool access - like having a team of experts available on-demand.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Copy specific subagents to your project**:

   ```bash
   # Copy a single agent
   cp subagents/prp-quality-agent/prp-quality-agent.md .claude/agents/
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   # List available agents
   /agents
   ```

3. **Claude will automatically use them** when appropriate tasks arise.

### code-reviewer ‚≠ê ENHANCED (Score: 9.8/10)

**Living Tree code review specialist** with intelligent command integration and adaptive review selection. This exceptionally well-designed agent bridges the gap between generic code review and Living Tree-specific requirements.

**üß† Intelligent Command Integration:**
- **Seamless Pattern Reuse**: Leverages existing `PRPs/commands/review-*.md` patterns rather than reinventing
- **Smart Selection Logic**: Uses bash pattern matching to intelligently route reviews based on user intent
- **Auto-Detection Fallback**: Gracefully handles ambiguous requests by analyzing git state
- **Context-Aware**: Doesn't just run commands blindly - understands intent and adapts dynamically

**üìä 8-Step Multi-Layered Review Process:**
1. **Context Analysis** ‚Üí Determines review scope from user request
2. **Command Selection** ‚Üí Routes to appropriate review pattern
3. **Language Analysis** ‚Üí Adapts focus for TypeScript/Python/SQL
4. **Security Scan** ‚Üí Prioritizes critical security issues
5. **Quality Gates** ‚Üí Executes type checking, linting, Docker builds
6. **Environment Impact** ‚Üí Analyzes dev/staging/production implications
7. **Command Integration** ‚Üí Executes Living Tree-specific patterns
8. **Output Generation** ‚Üí Creates consistent, actionable reports

**üéØ Smart Review Types:**
```bash
# Intelligent routing based on user intent:
"review staged changes"    ‚Üí Executes review-staged-unstaged.md pattern
"review my PR"            ‚Üí Executes review-general.md with PR focus
"security review"         ‚Üí Prioritizes security analysis (secrets, JWT, CORS)
"python review"           ‚Üí Focuses on FastAPI/Pydantic v2 patterns
"typescript review"       ‚Üí Focuses on Next.js 15/React patterns
"database review"         ‚Üí Focuses on RLS policies and migration safety
[No specific request]     ‚Üí Auto-detects based on file changes
```

**üîí Security-First Approach (10/10):**
- **Critical Issue Detection**: Prioritizes secret exposure with smart filtering
- **Production Safety**: Catches console.log/print statements with line numbers
- **JWT Validation**: Checks token handling and authentication patterns
- **CORS Configuration**: Validates origins and production settings
- **Input Sanitization**: Ensures API endpoints validate user input

**‚ö° Quality Gates Implementation:**
```bash
# Blocking issues that stop review:
- TypeScript type checking failures
- Docker build failures for backend changes
- Critical security vulnerabilities

# Warning issues that flag concerns:
- Python type checking issues
- Linting violations
- Missing test coverage
```

**üèóÔ∏è Living Tree Deep Integration:**
- **Framework-Specific**: Next.js 15 Promise-based params, Pydantic v2, Clerk auth
- **Convention Enforcement**: pnpm/poetry only, no docker-compose, proper file naming
- **Environment Awareness**: Different checks for dev/staging/production branches
- **Pattern Compliance**: Enforces project-specific conventions and best practices

**üìù Structured Output Formats:**
- **Staged/Unstaged Reviews**: Uses `review-staged-unstaged.md` template
- **General/PR Reviews**: Uses `review-general.md` comprehensive template
- **Auto-Incremented**: Reports saved as `review1.md`, `lt_review_1.md`, etc.
- **Consistent Location**: All reports in `PRPs/code_reviews/` directory

**üí° Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Intelligent selection based on context:
"do a code review"                      ‚Üí Auto-detects review type
"review staged changes"                 ‚Üí Staged/unstaged focused
"security review of API endpoints"      ‚Üí Security-priority analysis
"review this PR for production"         ‚Üí Production impact focus
"check my Python code"                  ‚Üí Python/FastAPI patterns
"review React components"                ‚Üí TypeScript/Next.js focus

# Automatic triggers (via hooks in settings.json):
User says "code review"     ‚Üí Agent auto-triggered with smart routing
User says "review changes"  ‚Üí Agent analyzes context and adapts
Large commits (>200 lines)   ‚Üí Proactive review suggestion
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How Subagents Work

### Core Features

- **Automatic Invocation**: Claude intelligently routes tasks to appropriate specialists
- **Isolated Context**: Each subagent has its own context window and system prompt
- **Specialized Tools**: Subagents can be granted specific tool access
- **Task Focus**: Designed for specific workflows or problem domains

### Agent Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When this agent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional - inherits all if omitted
model: sonnet # Optional - sonnet, opus
---

Your agent's system prompt and instructions go here.
```

### The /agents Command

Use `/agents` to:

- View all available subagents
- Modify tool access for agents
- Create new custom agents interactively

## üí° Creating Custom Subagents

### Basic Template

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use PROACTIVELY to review code changes for quality and security
tools: Read, Grep, WebSearch
---

You are a code review specialist. When you see code changes:

1. Check for security vulnerabilities
2. Verify code follows project patterns
3. Suggest improvements for readability
4. Ensure test coverage exists
```

### Best Practices

1. **Clear Descriptions**: Make the `description` field specific and action-oriented
2. **Proactive Keywords**: Use "PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" for automatic invocation
3. **Focused Scope**: Each agent should excel at one type of task
4. **Tool Selection**: Only grant tools the agent actually needs

## üé® Subagent Ideas

### Test Runner

```markdown
---
name: test-runner
description: Use PROACTIVELY to run tests after code changes
tools: Bash, Read, Edit
---

Run appropriate tests when code changes are made.
Fix simple test failures while preserving intent.
```

### Security Scanner

```markdown
---
name: security-scanner
description: Scan for security vulnerabilities in new code
tools: Read, Grep, WebSearch, Bash
---

Analyze code for OWASP vulnerabilities.
Check for exposed secrets or credentials.
Verify secure coding practices.
```

### Documentation Writer

```markdown
---
name: doc-writer
description: Generate and update documentation
tools: Read, Write, Edit
---

Create clear documentation for new features.
Update existing docs when code changes.
Ensure examples are accurate and helpful.
```

## üè• DevOps Automation System

The **devops-helper** agent is integrated with Claude Code's hook system to provide automated troubleshooting:

### Hook Integration

**ToolErrored Hooks** (Auto-trigger on errors):
```json
{
  "ToolErrored": [
    {
      "matcher": { "error_patterns": ["Port.*already in use", "EADDRINUSE"] },
      "hooks": [{ "type": "agent", "agent": "devops-helper", "timeout": 45 }]
    },
    {
      "matcher": { "error_patterns": ["JWSError", "Not valid base64url"] },
      "hooks": [{ "type": "agent", "agent": "devops-helper", "timeout": 30 }]
    }
  ]
}
```

**PreToolUse Hooks** (Proactive validation):
- Validates environment before deployment commands
- Checks ports before Docker operations
- Runs health checks before risky operations

### Available Scripts

The devops-helper agent leverages these Living Tree scripts:
- `scripts/deployment-health-check.sh` - Check deployment health
- `scripts/validate-deployment-env.sh` - Validate environment variables
- `scripts/dev-with-ports.sh` - Find available ports
- `scripts/docker-maintenance.sh` - Clean Docker resources
- `scripts/sync-env-enhanced.ts` - Sync secrets from GCP

### Testing

Run the complete DevOps automation test suite:
```bash
./.claude/hooks/test-devops-integration.sh
```

**Validation Score: 9/10** ‚úÖ - Excellent implementation ready for production use.
