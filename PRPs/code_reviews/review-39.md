# Code Review #39

## Summary

This change fixes a Gmail draft display issue where the sender name appears duplicated by explicitly setting the "From" header in email drafts and sent emails. A manual test script is also added to verify the fix.

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix)

- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py:9,11**: Unused imports `datetime` and `re` should be removed (detected by Pylance and flake8)
- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py:142**: Missing optional dependency `bs4` - should be handled gracefully or added to pyproject.toml

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)

- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py:228,188**: Missing type hints on `user_email` variable (should be `Optional[str]`)
- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py:226-233,186-193**: Duplicate code for getting user profile - should be extracted to a helper function
- **tests/manual/test_draft_fix.py:24-27**: Uses print() statements instead of logging - manual test scripts should use proper logging
- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py:18,341,364,401**: Unused functions flagged by Pylance - verify if these are actually used elsewhere

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor (Consider)

- **api/utils/gmail_helpers.py**: Consider caching the user profile result to avoid making multiple API calls when creating multiple drafts/emails
- **tests/manual/test_draft_fix.py**: Missing proper error handling types in except blocks
- **tests/manual/test_draft_fix.py**: Could benefit from command-line arguments instead of interactive input

## Good Practices

- Proper error handling with try/except blocks for the profile retrieval
- Good logging of success/warning states
- Comprehensive test script with clear verification steps
- Maintains backward compatibility by making From header optional
- Well-documented with clear comments about the critical fix

## Test Coverage

Current: N/A (manual test script) | Required: 80%
Missing tests: Automated unit tests for the modified `send_email` and `create_draft` functions

## Recommendations

1. Remove unused imports to clean up the code
2. Extract the profile retrieval logic to avoid duplication
3. Add the fix to the CLAUDE.md troubleshooting section for future reference
4. Consider adding automated tests for the Gmail helper functions
5. Handle the bs4 import more gracefully or document it as an optional dependency
