# Agentic Inbox Triage: Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

Law firm partners and associates spend 2-3 hours daily manually triaging hundreds of emails to identify urgent communications from clients, courts, and opposing counsel. This manual process creates cognitive overload, increases risk of missed deadlines, and reduces time available for billable work. Current legal practice management systems lack intelligent email analysis capabilities.

### Solution Overview

An intelligent email triage system that extends the existing Living Tree conversational agent with new proactive capabilities. The system adds autonomous email monitoring, intelligent classification, and priority detection tools that work within the current tool registry architecture. These enhanced tools will enable the existing chat agent to automatically analyze incoming Gmail messages, classify senders, detect urgency, and present prioritized results through both the existing chat interface and a new specialized dashboard.

### Success Metrics

- **Efficiency**: 70% reduction in manual email triage time
- **Accuracy**: 95% accuracy in priority classification
- **Risk Reduction**: Zero missed critical communications
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5/5 rating from legal professionals
- **ROI**: 15+ hours saved per attorney per week

## Market Analysis & Competitive Landscape

### Current Market State

The legal tech market is experiencing rapid AI adoption in 2024-2025:

- **Clio Duo**: Email assistance within practice management
- **Harvey AI**: General legal assistant with email capabilities
- **Candle AI**: Outlook/Gmail email assistant for lawyers
- **Checkbox.ai**: Legal intake and triage automation

### Market Gap

Existing solutions focus on **assistive** rather than **agentic** functionality. They require manual initiation and lack proactive, autonomous email analysis with legal-specific intelligence.

### Competitive Advantage

1. **Conversational AI Integration**: Built into existing chat interface users already know
2. **Tool-Based Architecture**: Extends proven tool registry system for modularity
3. **Legal-Specific Intelligence**: Court deadline detection, legal urgency keywords
4. **Proactive Operation**: Background monitoring with chat-based notifications
5. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: Gmail tools, auth, and streaming capabilities

   - **Monitoring**: Track API usage with alerting at 80% threshold

2. **OpenAI API Reliability**
   - **Risk**: Service outages affecting email analysis
   - **Mitigation**: Implement fallback to simpler rule-based classification
   - **Monitoring**: Circuit breaker pattern with automatic failover

3. **Database Performance at Scale**
   - **Risk**: Slow queries with large email volumes
   - **Mitigation**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
   - **Monitoring**: Database performance metrics and query analysis

#### Medium Priority Risks

4. **OAuth Token Expiration**
   - **Risk**: Lost access to user Gmail accounts
   - **Mitigation**: Automatic token refresh with user notification
   - **Monitoring**: Token expiration tracking and alerts

5. **Email Processing Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: Misclassification of important emails
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous learning from user feedback
   - **Monitoring**: Classification accuracy metrics and user override rates

### Business Risks

#### User Adoption Challenges

1. **Learning Curve**
   - **Risk**: Users resistant to AI-powered tools
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive onboarding and training program
   - **Success Metrics**: User engagement rates and feature adoption

2. **Data Privacy Concerns**

## Conclusion

The Agentic Inbox Triage system represents a significant advancement in legal technology, moving from passive assistance to proactive intelligence. By implementing a multi-agent architecture with specialized capabilities, the system addresses the core pain points of legal professionals while maintaining the human oversight required for ethical practice.

The comprehensive research, detailed specifications, and phased implementation approach provide a clear roadmap for delivering a production-ready system that will transform how law firms manage their most critical communication channel.

**Key Integration Points with Existing System:**

1. **Tool Registry Extension**: New triage tools will be added to the existing `available_tools` dictionary in `api/index.py`, following the same patterns as current Gmail tools

2. **Conversational Agent Enhancement**: The existing GPT-4o agent will gain new capabilities through additional tools, maintaining the same chat-based interaction model

3. **Frontend Integration**: Enhanced components will extend the existing chat interface rather than creating a separate dashboard, ensuring consistent user experience

4. **Infrastructure Reuse**: Leverages existing Clerk auth, Supabase database, Gmail OAuth, and OpenAI integration without duplication

5. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged; new features are purely additive

**Next Steps:**

1. Stakeholder review and approval of this PRD
2. Technical feasibility validation by extending existing Gmail tools
3. Implementation kickoff with Phase 1 database schema extension
4. Incremental deployment of new tools to existing tool registry

This PRD serves as the foundation for enhancing the existing Living Tree system with intelligent email triage capabilities, building upon rather than replacing the current architecture.
