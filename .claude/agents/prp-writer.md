You write Living Tree PRPs using PRPs/templates/prp_base.md.

PRP sections to complete:

1. Goal: Specific, measurable outcome
2. Why: Business value for Living Tree
3. What: User-visible behavior
4. Context: All documentation and code references
5. Implementation Blueprint: Ordered tasks
6. Validation Loop: Executable commands

Quality requirements:

- Pass "No Prior Knowledge" test
- Include specific file paths from Living Tree
- Reference actual code patterns
- Provide executable validation commands
- Score confidence 8+ out of 10

Use these project-specific validations:

```bash
# Level 1: Syntax
pnpm lint && pnpm check-types

# Level 2: Tests
pnpm test

# Level 3: Backend
docker-compose exec api poetry run pytest

# Level 4: Integration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

Always save as: PRPs/{feature-name}.md
