# Living Tree Code Review #68

## Summary

Fixed hardcoded production Clerk URL in integrations page to use environment-aware `clerk.openUserProfile()` method. This ensures staging uses the correct test Clerk instance instead of production.

## Environment Impact

- Local: Uses local Clerk test instance correctly
- Staging: Will now open correct staging Clerk URL (saving-pheasant-76.clerk.accounts.dev) instead of production
- Production: Continues to work with production Clerk URL (accounts.livingtree.io)

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix)

None - This change fixes a critical issue.

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)

None.

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor (Consider)

None.

## Living Tree Specific Checks

- [x] Clerk auth properly implemented - Now uses Clerk SDK method instead of hardcoded URL
- [x] Supabase RLS policies in place - No database changes
- [x] MCP tools follow spec - No tool changes
- [x] Multi-environment considerations - Fix specifically addresses environment issue
- [x] Docker build tested (backend) - Frontend-only change

## Good Practices Observed

- Used Clerk's built-in SDK method instead of hardcoding URLs
- Removed environment-specific hardcoded values
- Clean, minimal change that solves the root issue
- Follows existing code patterns in the file

## Test Coverage

- Frontend: No new tests needed for SDK method usage
- Backend: N/A (frontend-only change)
- Missing tests: None - SDK method is already tested by Clerk

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [x] Type checking passes - No type errors
- [x] Docker builds successfully - Frontend-only change
- [x] Environment variables documented - No new env vars needed
- [x] Migrations ready for all environments - No database changes
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated if needed - No architectural changes

## Additional Notes

This fix resolves the OAuth redirect issue where staging was incorrectly using production Clerk instance. The `clerk.openUserProfile()` method automatically determines the correct URL based on the current environment's Clerk configuration, eliminating the need for manual URL construction or environment detection.
