# Triage Date Range Fix Summary

## Issues Found

1. **Date Range Not Passed to Backend**: The frontend date picker selection was not being passed to the backend triage tool. The `triggerTriage` function was hardcoded to request "last 24 hours" regardless of user selection.

2. **API Date Filtering Issue**: The triage results API filters by `created_at` (when triage results were created) rather than when emails were received. This means selecting different date ranges only shows previously analyzed emails within that date range, not new emails from that period.

3. **Failed to Fetch Error**: Network errors weren't being handled with user-friendly messages.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `use-triage-data.ts`

- Modified `triggerTriage` function to accept optional `dateRange` parameter
- Calculate hours from date range and pass it to the backend via the prompt
- Added explicit instruction to use `triage_emails with since_hours={hours}`
- Improved error handling for network failures

### 2. Updated `triage-dashboard.tsx`

- Modified `handleTriggerTriage` to pass `filters.dateRange` to `triggerTriage`

## How It Works Now

1. User selects date range in the UI (e.g., "Last 7 days")
2. Date range is stored in `filters.dateRange`
3. When triggering analysis, the date range is converted to hours
4. The prompt now includes: `"Use triage_emails with since_hours={calculated_hours}"`
5. Backend AI will parse this instruction and call the tool with correct parameters

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Database Filtering**: The results API still filters by `created_at`. To show all emails from a date range:
   - Either modify the API to filter by email received date (requires storing that date)
   - Or ensure triage analysis is run regularly to have current data

2. **Maximum Emails**: The `triage_emails` tool defaults to 50 max emails. For longer date ranges, this may need adjustment.

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Select "Last 7 days" in the date picker
2. Click "Run Triage Analysis"
3. Monitor the console for: `ðŸ”¥ TRIAGE: Date range selected - 168 hours`
4. Check that the prompt includes: `Use triage_emails with since_hours=168`
