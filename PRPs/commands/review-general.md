# Code Review - Living Tree

Please perform a comprehensive code review of the current changes or specified files in the Living Tree project.

## Review Scope

$ARGUMENTS

## Living Tree Review Process

1. **Understand Changes**
   - If reviewing staged changes: `git diff --staged`
   - If reviewing specific files: Read the specified files
   - If reviewing a PR: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json files,additions,deletions`
   - If reviewing a local directory: `git diff $ARGUMENTS`
   - If reviewing against staging: `git diff origin/staging`
   - Check which environment this targets (staging vs production)

## Living Tree Review Focus Areas

1. **Code Quality**

   ### Frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
   - Next.js 15 patterns (Promise-based route params)
   - Proper use of 'use client' directive
   - TypeScript strict mode compliance
   - No `any` types
   - Proper error boundaries
   - SWR for data fetching
   - Path aliases (@/\*) used correctly

   ### Backend (FastAPI/Python)
   - Type hints on all functions and classes
   - Pydantic v2 models for data validation
   - No print() statements (use logging)
   - Proper async/await usage
   - Following PEP 8
   - Google-style docstrings
   - JWT token validation on all protected endpoints

2. **Living Tree Specific Patterns**

   ### Authentication
   - Clerk JWT validation in backend
   - Clerk hooks in frontend
   - User IDs as text type (not UUID)
   - Proper middleware usage

   ### Database (Supabase)
   - RLS policies for new tables
   - Migrations follow naming convention
   - Types regenerated after schema changes
   - Service role key only in backend

   ### MCP Tools
   - Proper tool response format
   - Error handling in tool execution
   - Tool permissions checked

3. **Security**

   ### Frontend
   - No exposed API keys (use NEXT*PUBLIC* prefix)
   - CORS properly configured
   - No sensitive data in client components

   ### Backend
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - SQL injection prevention (use Supabase client)
   - No hardcoded secrets
   - Proper error messages (no stack traces)

4. **Project Structure**
   - Monorepo conventions followed
   - Features self-contained in proper directories
   - Shared code in packages/
   - Tests co-located with code
   - No cross-package imports except from packages/

5. **Environment Management**
   - Environment-specific code properly isolated
   - Staging URLs used correctly
   - Docker builds tested for backend changes
   - Vercel configuration for frontend

6. **Type Safety & Linting**

   ### Pre-review Checks

   ```bash
   # TypeScript
   pnpm type-check

   # Python
   poetry run mypy api/ --strict

   # Linting
   pnpm lint
   poetry run flake8 api/

   # Docker (if backend changed)
   docker build -f api/Dockerfile -t test-backend .
   ```

7. **Testing**
   - New features have tests
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Component tests for UI changes
   - E2E considerations with Playwright MCP

8. **Performance**
   - No N+1 queries in backend
   - Proper React memoization
   - Image optimization in Next.js
   - API response streaming where appropriate

9. **Documentation**
   - CLAUDE.md updated with new patterns
   - API endpoints documented
   - Complex functions have docstrings
   - README updated if setup changed
