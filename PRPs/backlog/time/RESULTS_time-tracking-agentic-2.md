## Identified Security Risks and Attack Vectors

### Critical Risk Assessment

#### 1. AI Function Calling Vulnerabilities

**Risk Level**: **CRITICAL**
**Attack Vector**: Prompt injection leading to unauthorized tool execution

**Details**:

- OpenAI function calls can be manipulated through carefully crafted email content
- Malicious actors could embed prompts in emails to manipulate time tracking behavior
- Current implementation lacks input sanitization for AI-generated parameters

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Independent validation of all AI tool parameters
- Content filtering before AI processing
- Structured prompts with explicit boundaries
- Rate limiting for AI tool calls

#### 2. Email Content Privacy Exposure

**Risk Level**: **HIGH**
**Attack Vector**: Processing sensitive PII without proper classification

**Details**:

- Email content may contain confidential client information, financial data, or personal information
- Current Gmail integration processes raw email content without data classification
- Risk of inadvertent logging or storage of sensitive information

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Data classification engine before processing
- Content filtering with configurable exclusion patterns
- Encryption of all processed content
- Minimal data processing principles

#### 3. Cross-User Data Contamination

**Risk Level**: **HIGH**
**Attack Vector**: Insufficient user isolation in AI processing pipeline

**Details**:

- AI models could theoretically blend information across user contexts
- Shared processing infrastructure may leak information between users
- Database queries without proper user scoping

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Strict user isolation at all processing levels
- User-specific encryption keys
- Comprehensive access control validation
- Audit logging for all cross-user operations

#### 4. GDPR Compliance Violations

**Risk Level**: **HIGH**
**Attack Vector**: Processing personal data without lawful basis or consent

**Details**:

- Email scanning involves processing personal data requiring explicit consent
- Current implementation lacks data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability)
- No data retention policy enforcement
- Missing breach notification mechanisms

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Explicit consent management system
- Full data subject rights implementation
- Automated data retention enforcement
- Comprehensive audit trails for compliance

#### 5. OAuth Token Compromise

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**
**Attack Vector**: Exposure or misuse of Gmail OAuth tokens

**Details**:

- OAuth tokens provide broad Gmail access beyond time tracking needs
- Current token handling lacks scope limitation
- No token refresh or revocation handling

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Minimum necessary OAuth scopes
- Token encryption in storage
- Regular token refresh and validation
- Immediate revocation on security events

#### 6. Rate Limiting Bypass

**Risk Level**: **MEDIUM**
**Attack Vector**: Resource exhaustion through unlimited AI tool calls

**Details**:

- Current implementation lacks per-user rate limiting for AI operations
- Potential for denial of service through excessive email processing
- OpenAI API cost implications for unlimited calls

**Mitigation Strategy**:

- Per-user and per-operation rate limiting
- Tiered access controls based on user subscription
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API calls
- Cost monitoring and alerting
