# SPEC: Deployment Pipeline Hardening - Phase 2

## Overview

Complete the deployment pipeline hardening by implementing tests, monitoring, and health checks to prevent future deployment failures.

## Current State

```yaml
current_state:
  completed_items:
    - Supabase CLI authentication fixed in GitHub Actions
    - Environment validation script created (validate-deployment-env.sh)
    - Documentation updated (TROUBLESHOOTING.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)
    - JWT validation improved
    - Color/JSON output modes added

  missing_items:
    - No tests for validation script
    - No deployment health checks
    - No monitoring/alerting system
    - Supabase CLI version not pinned
    - Manual Vercel configuration not documented

  files:
    - scripts/validate-deployment-env.sh (untested)
    - .github/workflows/database-migrations.yml (unpinned versions)
    - No health check scripts
    - No test files

  issues:
    - Validation script could break without tests
    - No visibility into deployment health
    - Version drift could reintroduce issues
    - Manual steps not documented
```

## Desired State

```yaml
desired_state:
  files:
    - scripts/validate-deployment-env.sh (tested)
    - scripts/test-validate-deployment-env.sh (new)
    - scripts/deployment-health-check.sh (new)
    - .github/workflows/database-migrations.yml (pinned versions)
    - .github/workflows/deployment-monitor.yml (new)
    - docs/vercel-configuration-guide.md (new)

  behavior:
    - Automated tests validate all script functionality
    - Health checks run after deployments
    - Alerts notify team of failures
    - Versions are locked to prevent drift
    - Clear documentation for manual steps

  benefits:
    - Confidence in validation script reliability
    - Early detection of deployment issues
    - Faster incident response
    - Predictable CI/CD behavior
    - Reduced onboarding friction
```

### 3. Low-Level Tasks

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Validation Script Tests

```yaml
create_validation_tests:
  action: CREATE
  file: scripts/test-validate-deployment-env.sh
  changes: |
    - Create comprehensive test suite
    - Test color detection logic
    - Test JSON output formatting
    - Test JWT validation functions
    - Test environment-specific checks
    - Test error conditions
  validation:
    - command: "./scripts/test-validate-deployment-env.sh"
    - expect: "All tests passed"
```

### Task 2: Pin Supabase CLI Version

```yaml
pin_supabase_version:
  action: MODIFY
  file: .github/workflows/database-migrations.yml
  changes: |
    - Find: uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
            with:
              version: latest
    - Replace with: uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
                    with:
                      version: 1.123.4  # Pin to specific version
  validation:
    - command: "grep 'version: 1.' .github/workflows/database-migrations.yml"
    - expect: "version: 1.123.4"
```

### Task 3: Create Health Check Script

```yaml
create_health_check:
  action: CREATE
  file: scripts/deployment-health-check.sh
  changes: |
    - Check service availability
    - Verify database connectivity
    - Test API endpoints
    - Check environment variables
    - Return structured results
  validation:
    - command: "./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh --help"
    - expect: "Usage: deployment-health-check.sh"
```

### Task 4: Add Deployment Monitoring Workflow

```yaml
create_monitoring_workflow:
  action: CREATE
  file: .github/workflows/deployment-monitor.yml
  changes: |
    - Trigger after deployments
    - Run health checks
    - Send notifications on failure
    - Create status badges
  validation:
    - command: "yq eval '.jobs.monitor' .github/workflows/deployment-monitor.yml"
    - expect: "name: Run Health Checks"
```

### Task 5: Document Vercel Configuration

```yaml
document_vercel_config:
  action: CREATE
  file: docs/vercel-configuration-guide.md
  changes: |
    - Step-by-step Vercel setup
    - Required environment variables
    - Screenshots of configuration
    - Common issues and solutions
    - Verification steps
  validation:
    - command: "grep -c 'NEXT_PUBLIC_' docs/vercel-configuration-guide.md"
    - expect: "5" # At least 5 env var mentions
```

### Task 6: Create GitHub Actions Test Workflow

```yaml
add_validation_tests_to_ci:
  action: CREATE
  file: .github/workflows/test-deployment-tools.yml
  changes: |
    - Run validation script tests
    - Test in multiple environments
    - Cache dependencies
    - Report coverage
  validation:
    - command: "grep 'test-validate-deployment-env.sh' .github/workflows/test-deployment-tools.yml"
    - expect: "./scripts/test-validate-deployment-env.sh"
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1: Testing** (Tasks 1, 6)
   - Create and integrate tests first
   - Ensures existing functionality is preserved

2. **Phase 2: Version Control** (Task 2)
   - Pin versions to prevent drift
   - Quick win with immediate impact

3. **Phase 3: Health Monitoring** (Tasks 3, 4)
   - Add visibility into deployment health
   - Enable proactive issue detection

4. **Phase 4: Documentation** (Task 5)
   - Capture manual processes
   - Reduce tribal knowledge

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Test Complexity**: Bash testing can be tricky
   - Mitigation: Use simple, clear test patterns
   - Fallback: Consider bats-core testing framework

2. **Monitoring Overhead**: Too many alerts cause fatigue
   - Mitigation: Start with critical alerts only
   - Progressive enhancement approach

3. **Version Pinning**: May miss security updates
   - Mitigation: Monthly review process
   - Dependabot for automated PRs

## Rollback Strategy

Each task is independent and can be rolled back:

- Tests: Simply remove test files
- Version pinning: Revert to 'latest'
- Health checks: Disable workflows
- Documentation: Keep as reference

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Validation script has >90% test coverage
- [ ] All GitHub workflows use pinned versions
- [ ] Health checks run automatically after deployments
- [ ] Zero manual configuration steps undocumented
- [ ] Deployment failures detected within 5 minutes

## Integration Points

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: New test workflows
- **Monitoring Systems**: Health check integration
- **Documentation Site**: New guides
- **Team Notifications**: Alert channels

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Implement Phase 1 (Testing)
3. Validate improvements
4. Continue with remaining phases

**Status**: Ready for implementation
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours total
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevents future deployment failures
