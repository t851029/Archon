## Architecture Comparison

All approaches implement the same agentic architecture:

```python
# Tools registered in available_tools dictionary
available_tools = {
    "scan_billable_time": scan_billable_time,
    "analyze_time_entry": analyze_time_entry,
    "get_time_tracking_summary": get_time_tracking_summary,
    "configure_time_tracking": configure_time_tracking,
}
```

The differences lie in:

- **Performance**: Caching layers, concurrent processing
- **Security**: Encryption, authentication, audit logging
- **Maintainability**: Service layers, testing coverage
- **Rapid**: Direct implementation, minimal abstraction
- **Enterprise**: Monitoring, alerting, operational procedures

## Conclusion

The **Rapid Development approach is recommended as the starting point** for most organizations, as it:

- Provides immediate value (6 hours to deployment)
- Validates the concept with real users
- Uses proven patterns with minimal risk
- Allows for iterative enhancement

Once deployed, enhance with elements from other approaches based on your specific needs. This pragmatic strategy balances speed, quality, and risk while ensuring you can adapt based on actual user feedback and requirements.
