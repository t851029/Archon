```

### Failure Detection & Response (Powered by Grafana Cloud)

```yaml
failure_detection:
  observability_metrics:
    - API response time > 2000ms (from OTEL traces in Tempo)
    - Error rate > 1% (from structured logs in Loki)
    - Database connection failures (from Supabase metrics)
    - Authentication failures > 5% (from correlation ID analysis)
    - Memory usage > 80% (from OTEL resource metrics)
    - Disk usage > 85% (from system metrics)
    - Trace error rate > 2% (from distributed tracing)
    - Log correlation breaks (missing request_id patterns)

  grafana_queries:
    - Loki: `{service="living-tree-api"} |= "ERROR" | json | error_rate > 0.01`
    - Tempo: `{service.name="living-tree-api"} && status=error`
    - Prometheus: `supabase_database_connections_active / supabase_database_connections_max > 0.8`

  response_actions:
    - Immediate alert to team with Grafana dashboard links
    - Trigger automated rollback if critical with trace correlation
    - Generate detailed incident report with trace IDs and log queries
    - Preserve logs, metrics, and traces in Grafana Cloud
    - Create Grafana annotation for incident timeline
    - Schedule post-incident review with observability data
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

#### 1. Test Suite Complexity Risk

- **Risk**: Test suite becomes too complex to maintain
- **Mitigation**: Modular test design, clear documentation, regular review
- **Monitoring**: Test execution time, maintenance burden

#### 2. False Positive Risk

- **Risk**: Tests fail due to environmental issues, not code problems
- **Mitigation**: Robust retry logic, environment isolation, clear error messages
- **Monitoring**: False positive rate tracking

#### 3. Performance Impact Risk

- **Risk**: Extensive testing slows down deployment pipeline
- **Mitigation**: Parallel test execution, incremental testing, caching
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline execution time

#### 4. Test Coverage Gaps Risk

- **Risk**: Critical scenarios not covered by tests
- **Mitigation**: Regular coverage analysis, production issue retrospectives
- **Monitoring**: Code coverage metrics, incident analysis
