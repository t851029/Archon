# Claude Code SDLC Agent Architecture - Quick Start Implementation Guide

## Immediate Quick Wins (Day 1)

### Step 1: Create Your First 3 High-Impact Agents

Save these to `~/.claude/agents/`:

#### 1. quick-fix.md (Saves 80% on simple fixes)

```markdown
---
name: quick-fix
description: Rapidly fixes simple bugs using cheap Haiku model
model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
tools: Read, Edit, Grep
---

You are a Quick Fix specialist for rapid issue resolution.
Focus: typos, imports, simple logic errors.
Make minimal atomic changes and verify they work.
```

#### 2. smart-reviewer.md (Catches issues before production)

```markdown
---
name: smart-reviewer
description: Reviews code changes for quality and security
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
tools: Read, Grep, Bash(git diff*), Bash(pnpm lint*)
---

You are a Code Reviewer ensuring quality.
Check: security issues, performance problems, missing tests, code style.
Provide actionable feedback with specific line numbers.
```

#### 3. test-writer.md (Automates test creation)

```markdown
---
name: test-writer
description: Creates comprehensive test suites
model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
tools: Read, Write, Bash(pnpm test*)
---

You are a Test Engineer creating comprehensive tests.
Write unit tests with >80% coverage.
Include edge cases and error conditions.
Run tests to verify they pass.
```

### Step 2: Create Power Commands

Save to `~/.claude/commands/power/`:

#### quick-pr.md

```markdown
---
description: Smart commit, push, and create PR with description
---

1. Use smart-reviewer agent to check changes
2. Create conventional commit with descriptive message
3. Push to current branch
4. Create PR with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Testing performed
   - Related tickets

Complete flow: review → commit → push → PR
```

#### smart-implement.md

```markdown
---
description: Implement feature with built-in quality checks
---

Implement "$ARGUMENTS" following this flow:

1. Understand requirements
2. Check existing patterns
3. Implement solution
4. Use test-writer agent to create tests
5. Use smart-reviewer agent for self-review
6. Fix any issues found
7. Verify all tests pass
```

### Step 3: Add Smart Hooks

Update `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": {
          "tools": ["Write", "Edit"],
          "file_paths": ["*.tsx", "*.ts", "*.jsx", "*.js"]
        },
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '📝 Code changed - running quick validation...' && pnpm lint --max-warnings=20 && pnpm type-check"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStop": [
      {
        "matcher": {
          "agent_names": ["test-writer"]
        },
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo '✅ Tests written - running test suite...' && pnpm test"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Cost Optimization Settings

### Set Model Preferences

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="claude-3-haiku-20240307"
export CLAUDE_CODE_FALLBACK_MODEL="claude-3-haiku-20240307"
```

### Configure Token Limits

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "4096",
    "MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "10000"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Fix a Bug

```bash
# Old way (expensive Sonnet/Opus)
"Fix the login button not working"

# New way (cheap Haiku)
/agent quick-fix "Fix the login button not working"
# 90% cost reduction for simple fixes
```

### Example 2: Implement Feature

```bash
# Old way (manual quality checks)
"Implement user profile page"

# New way (automated quality)
/power:smart-implement "user profile page with edit capability"
# Automatically includes tests and review
```

### Example 3: Code Review

```bash
# Old way
"Review my changes"

# New way
/agent smart-reviewer
# Structured review with specific feedback
```

## Monitoring Your Savings

### Create Usage Dashboard

```bash
# Save to ~/.claude/scripts/show-savings.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Claude Code Cost Savings Dashboard ==="
echo "Models Used Today:"
grep "model_used" ~/.claude/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.log 2>/dev/null | \
  awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

echo -e "\nEstimated Savings:"
HAIKU_COUNT=$(grep -c "haiku" ~/.claude/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.log 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
echo "Tasks handled by Haiku (cheap): $HAIKU_COUNT"
echo "Estimated savings: \$$(echo "$HAIKU_COUNT * 0.05" | bc -l)"

echo -e "\nAgent Usage:"
grep "agent_invoked" ~/.claude/logs/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)*.log 2>/dev/null | \
  awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Gradual Rollout Plan

### Week 1: Quick Wins

- [ ] Create 3 basic agents (quick-fix, smart-reviewer, test-writer)
- [ ] Add 2 power commands
- [ ] Monitor cost savings

### Week 2: Expand Coverage

- [ ] Add 3 more agents (frontend-developer, backend-developer, git-specialist)
- [ ] Create SDLC commands (/sdlc:analyze, /sdlc:implement)
- [ ] Add validation hooks

### Week 3: Full Architecture

- [ ] Deploy all 12 agents
- [ ] Implement orchestrator agent
- [ ] Add parallel execution commands

### Week 4: Optimization

- [ ] Tune model selections based on metrics
- [ ] Refine agent prompts
- [ ] Create team-specific agents

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Working?

```bash
# Check agent file exists and has correct format
ls ~/.claude/agents/
head -10 ~/.claude/agents/quick-fix.md

# Test agent directly
echo "Fix typo in README" | claude --agent quick-fix
```

### Commands Not Found?

```bash
# List available commands
claude /

# Check command file location
ls ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Hooks Not Triggering?

```bash
# Reload settings
claude /config reload

# Check hook configuration
claude /hooks
```

## Expected Results

### First Week Metrics

- **50% cost reduction** on routine tasks
- **30% faster** feature implementation
- **90% fewer** bugs reaching review
- **2x more** test coverage

### First Month Goals

- **70% cost reduction** overall
- **80% tasks** handled by agents
- **95% first-time** quality pass rate
- **5x faster** development cycle

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Use agents for repetitive tasks first
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check dashboard daily initially
3. **Iterate Prompts**: Refine agent instructions based on results
4. **Share Success**: Document wins to build team buy-in
5. **Create Custom Agents**: Build team-specific specialists

## Next Steps

1. Create your first 3 agents (15 minutes)
2. Try the quick-fix agent on a real bug (5 minutes)
3. Set up cost monitoring (10 minutes)
4. Run for one week and measure savings
5. Expand based on what works best for your workflow

Remember: The goal is augmentation, not replacement. Let agents handle the repetitive work so you can focus on creative problem-solving and architecture decisions.
