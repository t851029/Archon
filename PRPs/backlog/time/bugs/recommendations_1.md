Debug Summary

  Issue 1: Connection Refused Error ✅ FIXED

  Root Cause: The local Supabase services were not running properly, causing
  the database connection to fail with "Connection refused [Errno 111]"

  Fix Applied:
  1. Restarted Supabase services with npx supabase stop && npx supabase start
  2. Reset the database to apply all migrations with npx supabase db reset
  3. The time_tracking_results table was successfully created

  Verification: The get_time_tracking_summary function now works correctly
  and returns results (empty set as expected since no data has been stored
  yet)

  Issue 2: Test Coverage ✅ IMPROVED

  Test Cases Executed:

  | Test Case                      | Status     | Notes
                             |
  |--------------------------------|------------|----------------------------
  ---------------------------|
  | TC-001: Tool Registration      | ✅ PASS     | All 4 tools properly
  registered                       |
  | TC-002: Basic Time Scanning    | ✅ PASS     | Successfully detects time
  entries                     |
  | TC-003: Single Email Analysis  | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Tool was called but didn't
  analyze the specific email |
  | TC-006: Time Summary Retrieval | ✅ PASS     | Now works after database
  fix                          |
  | TC-007: Configuration Settings | ✅ PASS     | Configuration tool works
  correctly                    |

  Additional Findings

  1. UI Formatting Issue (Previously Fixed): Time tracking results now
  display in formatted cards instead of raw JSON
  2. Tool Execution Issues:
    - The analyze_time_entry tool needs an email ID but the AI isn't
  extracting it properly
    - May need to improve the prompt engineering or tool descriptions
  3. Working Features:
    - ✅ All 4 time tracking tools are callable
    - ✅ Database connection is working
    - ✅ Time scanning detects entries correctly
    - ✅ Results are formatted nicely in the UI
    - ✅ Configuration tool works

  Prevention Recommendations

  1. Database Setup: Always ensure Supabase is running before testing
  database-dependent features
  2. Migration Verification: Run npx supabase db reset after adding new
  migrations
  3. Service Health Checks: Add health check endpoints to verify all services
   are running
  4. Tool Testing: Create automated tests for each tool function
  5. Error Messages: Improve error messages to be more specific about
  connection issues
