# Root Cause Analysis: Time Tracking Tool Not Available on Staging

**Date**: August 10, 2025  
**Issue**: `get_time_tracking_summary` tool not available on staging.livingtree.io but works locally  
**Reporter**: Jerin Stewart  
**Investigator**: Claude Code Assistant  

## Executive Summary

The time tracking tool appeared unavailable on staging because the staging environment was running an outdated deployment (commit `b9b3a18af`) that predated the addition of the time tracking functionality. The tool was added in the `jerin/lt-139-time-reviewer-tool` branch but had not been deployed to staging.

## Issue Description

### Symptoms
- User query: "What time tracking tools are available?" on https://staging.livingtree.io/chat
- AI response: "It looks like the tool you requested ("get_time_tracking_summary") is not available in the current environment"
- Same query works correctly in local development environment

### Expected Behavior
The AI should recognize and be able to call the `get_time_tracking_summary` tool to provide time tracking data summaries.

## Troubleshooting Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Investigation (Incorrect Path)

#### Steps Taken:
1. **Reproduced the issue using Playwright MCP server**
   - Navigated to staging.livingtree.io/chat
   - Submitted query: "What time tracking tools are available?"
   - Confirmed AI responded that tool was not available

2. **Checked backend logs in Google Cloud Run**
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=living-tree-backend-staging"
   ```
   - Found no errors during the time of testing
   - Backend health checks were passing

3. **Verified tool configuration in codebase**
   - Confirmed `get_time_tracking_summary` defined in `api/index.py:990`
   - Verified tool registered in `available_tools` dictionary
   - Found tool implementation in `api/utils/tools.py`

#### Initial (Incorrect) Diagnosis:
Initially concluded this was an AI reasoning issue where OpenAI's model wasn't recognizing the tool due to authentication requirements (`get_secure_time_tracking_context` dependency).

### Phase 2: Deeper Investigation (Correct Path)

#### Critical Discovery Steps:

1. **Checked deployment commit on staging**
   ```bash
   gcloud run services describe living-tree-backend-staging --region=northamerica-northeast1 --format="value(metadata.labels.commit-sha)"
   # Result: b9b3a18af6395d1a2c975d6cdcf702c442ebdc0d
   ```

2. **Compared with current branch**
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   # Result: c8c78c9d2ec7683b9b1aa24f589f57fc7267311d
   ```

3. **Verified tool existence in staging commit**
   ```bash
   git show b9b3a18:api/index.py | grep -c "get_time_tracking_summary"
   # Result: 0 (tool not present!)
   ```

4. **Analyzed commit history**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat b9b3a18..HEAD | grep -E "api/(index|utils/tools)"
   # Result: Significant changes to both files
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause
**Outdated Deployment**: The staging environment was running commit `b9b3a18af` from before the time tracking functionality was implemented. The `get_time_tracking_summary` tool was added in later commits on the `jerin/lt-139-time-reviewer-tool` branch.

### Contributing Factors
1. **No automated branch deployments**: Feature branches aren't automatically deployed to staging
2. **Manual deployment process**: Requires explicit push to staging branch
3. **No deployment status indicators**: Difficult to quickly verify which version is deployed

## Timeline of Events

1. **Baseline**: Staging deployed with commit `b9b3a18af`
2. **Development**: Time tracking tools added in `jerin/lt-139-time-reviewer-tool` branch
3. **Local Testing**: Features work correctly in local development
4. **Staging Testing**: Features fail because staging still running old code
5. **Investigation**: Initially misdiagnosed as AI/authentication issue
6. **Discovery**: Identified deployment version mismatch

## Fix Implementation

### Immediate Fix
Deploy the latest code to staging:
```bash
# Option 1: Direct deployment
git push origin jerin/lt-139-time-reviewer-tool:staging

# Option 2: Merge and deploy
git checkout staging
git merge jerin/lt-139-time-reviewer-tool
git push origin staging
```

### Verification Steps
1. Wait for GitHub Actions deployment to complete
2. Verify new commit SHA on Cloud Run
3. Test time tracking tool availability on staging

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Systematic debugging approach using multiple tools (Playwright, gcloud CLI, git)
- Comprehensive log analysis
- Thorough code verification

### What Could Be Improved
- Should have checked deployment version earlier in investigation
- Initial assumption about AI reasoning was premature
- Need better deployment status visibility

## Prevention Measures

### Short-term
1. **Add deployment status check to debugging checklist**
   - Always verify deployed commit SHA matches expected version
   - Compare staging vs. local codebases before deep debugging

2. **Create deployment verification script**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # check-deployment.sh
   STAGING_SHA=$(gcloud run services describe living-tree-backend-staging --region=northamerica-northeast1 --format="value(metadata.labels.commit-sha)")
   LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   echo "Staging: $STAGING_SHA"
   echo "Local: $LOCAL_SHA"
   git diff --stat $STAGING_SHA..$LOCAL_SHA
   ```

### Long-term
1. **Implement preview deployments**
   - Auto-deploy feature branches to preview environments
   - Use Vercel preview URLs pattern for backend

2. **Add deployment status dashboard**
   - Display current commit SHA on staging/production
   - Show deployment timestamp
   - Link to commit diff from production

3. **Enhance CI/CD pipeline**
   - Add tool availability tests
   - Automated smoke tests after deployment
   - Notification system for deployment status

4. **Improve error messages**
   - Include deployment version in API responses
   - Add `/api/version` endpoint for quick checks

## Key Takeaways

1. **Always verify deployment versions first** when features work locally but not in deployed environments
2. **Don't assume complex causes** (AI reasoning, authentication) before checking simple ones (deployment status)
3. **Document deployment processes** clearly to avoid confusion
4. **Implement deployment visibility** to make version mismatches immediately obvious

## Action Items

- [ ] Deploy latest code to staging (immediate)
- [ ] Create deployment verification script (this week)
- [ ] Document deployment process in README (this week)
- [ ] Propose preview deployment system (next sprint)
- [ ] Add version endpoint to API (next sprint)

*This RCA demonstrates the importance of checking fundamental assumptions (deployment status) before diving into complex debugging scenarios. The issue appeared to be an AI/authentication problem but was actually a simple case of outdated code on staging.*
