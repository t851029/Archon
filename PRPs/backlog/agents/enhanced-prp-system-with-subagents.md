# Enhanced PRP System with Claude Code Subagents

## Goal

Design and implement an enhanced PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) system that leverages Claude Code's latest subagent capabilities, hooks, and commands to optimize context management, model selection, and workflow efficiency while maintaining the existing PRP system's proven effectiveness.

## Why

- **Context Optimization**: Subagents provide isolated context windows, preventing pollution and enabling deeper analysis
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use appropriate models (Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex) to optimize API usage
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple specialized agents can work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Workflow Automation**: Hooks and event-driven patterns reduce manual intervention
- **Team Scalability**: Standardized subagent configurations can be shared across teams

## What

An enhanced PRP system that:

- Maintains existing PRP templates and commands (backward compatible)
- Adds specialized subagents for different PRP workflow stages
- Implements smart model selection based on task complexity
- Uses hooks for automated quality checks and workflow management
- Provides clear development flows with visual diagrams

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All existing PRP commands continue working unchanged
- [ ] New subagents reduce Opus usage by 40% through smart model selection
- [ ] PRP creation time improved through parallel research
- [ ] Automated validation gates via hooks
- [ ] Clear documentation and mermaid diagrams for workflows

### Current System Analysis

The existing PRP system uses:

- **Commands**: 24 custom commands in PRPs/commands/
- **Templates**: 5 templates in PRPs/templates/
- **Core Workflow**: Research → Context Curation → PRP Generation → Execution
- **Validation**: Executable gates for self-correction

  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|MultiEdit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/auto-format.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }

## Enhanced Command Integration

The existing commands remain unchanged but gain enhanced capabilities:

### /create-base-prp

- Now triggers parallel research agents
- Automatically validates PRP quality
- Suggests improvements based on validation

### /execute-base-prp

- Orchestrates code-generator with supporting agents
- Runs validation loops automatically
- Handles test generation in parallel

### /review-general

- Can now trigger code-reviewer subagent
- Provides more thorough analysis
- Suggests specific improvements

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)

1. Install subagent configurations in `.claude/agents/`
2. Configure hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
3. Test with non-critical features

### Phase 2: Validation (Week 2)

1. Run parallel with existing workflow
2. Compare results and efficiency
3. Tune model selections

### Phase 3: Rollout (Week 3)

1. Team training on new capabilities
2. Documentation updates
3. Full deployment

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Improvements

- **Context Clarity**: 50% reduction in context pollution
- **Opus Usage**: 40% reduction through smart model selection
- **Development Speed**: 30% faster through parallel execution
- **Error Rate**: 25% reduction through automated validation
- **PRP Quality**: 35% improvement in one-pass success rate

### Monitoring

```bash
# Track agent usage
claude config get parallelTasksCount

# Monitor model distribution
grep "model:" .claude/agents/*.md | sort | uniq -c

# Measure PRP success rate
find PRPs/completed/ -name "*.md" -exec grep "confidence:" {} \; | awk '{sum+=$2; count++} END {print sum/count}'
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Configuration Validation

```bash
# Verify subagent setup
ls -la .claude/agents/
claude mcp list

# Test hook configuration
claude --hooks
```

### Level 2: Workflow Testing

```bash
# Test PRP creation with new system
/create-base-prp "test authentication feature"

# Verify parallel execution
claude --verbose -p "implement user profile"
```

### Level 3: Quality Metrics

```bash
# Measure improvement
time /execute-base-prp PRPs/test-feature.md

# Check model usage
claude config get --global parallelTasksCount
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Solution: Configure max parallel agents to 4
   - Fallback: Sequential execution mode

2. **Context Loss**
   - Solution: Main orchestrator maintains critical context
   - Fallback: CLAUDE.md for persistent context

3. **Subagent Failures**
   - Solution: Graceful degradation to main agent
   - Fallback: Manual intervention points

4. **Team Adoption**
   - Solution: Gradual rollout with training
   - Fallback: Maintain backward compatibility

## Conclusion

This enhanced PRP system leverages Claude Code's latest capabilities while maintaining the proven effectiveness of the existing system. The modular design allows gradual adoption, and the backward compatibility ensures no disruption to current workflows.

### Key Benefits

1. **Maintained Simplicity**: Existing commands work unchanged
2. **Enhanced Capability**: Parallel execution and smart model selection
3. **Cost Optimization**: Appropriate model usage reduces API costs
4. **Quality Improvement**: Automated validation increases success rates
5. **Team Scalability**: Shareable configurations improve collaboration

### Implementation Confidence Score: 9/10

The high confidence score reflects:

- Complete research and documentation
