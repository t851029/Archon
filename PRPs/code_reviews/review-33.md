# Code Review #33

## Summary

Implementation of a flexible port configuration system for the Living Tree application. The changes allow developers to run multiple instances simultaneously by automatically detecting available ports or specifying custom ports via environment variables. The implementation is well-structured and follows good practices.

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix)

None found. The implementation handles port detection safely and includes proper error handling.

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)

- **scripts/lib/check-ports.sh**: Missing error handling if neither `lsof` nor `nc` commands are available. Consider adding a fallback or error message.
- **scripts/dev-with-ports.sh:52**: Uses `exec pnpm dev` which replaces the current process. Consider whether you want to trap signals for cleanup before exec.
- **api/core/config.py:105**: Dynamic CORS addition only happens for local environment but the comment and functionality could be clearer about this limitation.

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor (Consider)

- **scripts/dev-with-ports.sh**: Could benefit from a `--help` flag to show usage instructions
- **scripts/dev-with-ports.ps1**: PowerShell script could use parameter validation attributes for better error messages
- **docs/guides/custom-ports.md**: Could include a section on Docker network considerations when using custom ports
- **API_PORT in package.json**: The `dev:api:docker` script still hardcodes port 8000 - should this also use `${API_PORT:-8000}`?

## Good Practices

- **Cross-platform support**: Separate scripts for Unix/Mac and Windows ensure broad compatibility
- **Environment variable patterns**: Proper use of `${VAR:-default}` syntax for fallback values
- **Type safety preserved**: Changes to TypeScript files maintain proper types
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation added to CLAUDE.md, README.md, and custom guide
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing workflows remain unchanged; new functionality is opt-in
- **Proper port detection**: Uses appropriate tools (`lsof` with `nc` fallback) for port checking
- **CORS security**: Dynamic CORS origins only added in local environment, not staging/production

## Test Coverage

Current: N/A (shell scripts) | Required: N/A
Missing tests: While the shell scripts don't require traditional unit tests, the implementation includes validation commands that serve as basic tests.

## Additional Observations

### Security Considerations

- Port detection is limited to localhost, preventing potential security issues
- CORS configuration properly restricts dynamic origins to local development only
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information introduced

### Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead: Port checking only happens at startup
- No runtime performance impact on the application

### Code Quality

- Shell scripts follow consistent style and use proper error handling with `set -e`
- Python changes maintain existing code style and patterns
- TypeScript/JavaScript changes use appropriate template literals

### Documentation Quality

- Clear, concise documentation added to multiple files
- Examples provided for common use cases
- Troubleshooting section included for common issues

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding a GitHub Action to validate the shell scripts syntax
2. Add integration to the Docker setup to ensure port environment variables are properly passed to containers
3. Consider adding a flag to disable automatic port detection for CI/CD environments
4. The removed Supabase configuration in `apps/web/supabase/` appears to be cleanup of duplicate files - verify this was intentional

## Conclusion

This is a well-implemented feature that solves a real developer pain point. The code is clean, well-documented, and maintains backward compatibility. The minor issues identified are not blockers and can be addressed in a follow-up if needed.
