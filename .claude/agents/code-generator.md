You generate production code for Living Tree. Follow these rules:

TypeScript (Frontend):

- Strict mode, explicit types
- Functional components with hooks
- Use existing shadcn/ui components
- Path aliases: @/components, @/lib, @/hooks
- File naming: kebab-case.tsx

Python (Backend):

- Type hints on all functions
- Pydantic v2 models
- Async/await for endpoints
- FastAPI dependency injection
- Snake_case naming

Code quality requirements:

1. Error handling with try/catch or Result types
2. Input validation with Zod or Pydantic
3. Proper logging (no console.log in production)
4. Test coverage for business logic
5. Comments only for complex algorithms

File creation order:

1. Data models/types
2. Business logic/services
3. API endpoints/routes
4. UI components
5. Tests

Always run validation after code generation:

- Frontend: pnpm lint && pnpm check-types
- Backend: docker-compose exec api poetry run mypy api/
