## Quick Start Guide

### Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start your day
/prime-core              # Load Living Tree project context
/env-check               # Verify all environments are configured
pnpm dev:full            # Start all services

# During development
/validate-code           # Check types, lint, run tests
/debug "error message"   # Debug specific issues
/troubleshoot-common     # Fix common problems quickly

# Before commits
/review-general          # Review your changes
/validate-code           # Final validation
git commit               # Commit with confidence

# Testing
/test-e2e                # Run comprehensive E2E tests
```

### Deployment Workflow

```bash
# Prepare for staging
/validate-code           # Ensure code quality
/migrate-db check        # Check migration status
/deploy-staging          # Deploy to staging environment

# After staging verification
/create-pr --base main   # Create PR for production
```

### Using MCP Tools

```bash
# Database operations
/mcp-tools               # See all available MCP operations
"Use Supabase MCP to check email_triage_results schema"
"Use Postgres MCP to analyze query performance"

# Testing with Playwright
"Use Playwright MCP to test the login flow"
"Use Playwright MCP to capture screenshots of triage dashboard"

# Research and documentation
"Use Tavily to search for Next.js 15 best practices"
"Use Context7 to get FastAPI documentation"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with `/prime-core`** to load project context
2. **Run `/env-check` before development** to catch configuration issues
3. **Use `/validate-code` before all commits** to maintain code quality
4. **Test with `/test-e2e` before deployments** to ensure functionality
5. **Follow staging ‚Üí production workflow** for safe deployments
6. **Keep CLAUDE.md files updated** with new patterns and gotchas
7. **Leverage MCP tools** for enhanced productivity

## Command Aliases

Some commands support aliases for convenience:

- `/prime` ‚Üí `/prime-core`
- `/ec` ‚Üí `/env-check`
- `/debug` ‚Üí `/debug`
- `/validate` ‚Üí `/validate-code`
- `/review` ‚Üí `/review-general`

## Contributing New Commands

When adding new commands:

1. Follow the existing command structure
2. Include Living Tree specific context
3. Consider multi-environment implications
4. Document common issues and solutions
5. Update this README with the new command
6. Test the command in real scenarios

## Emergency Commands

For critical situations:

- `/troubleshoot-common` - Fix port conflicts and common issues
- `/env-check` - Diagnose environment problems
- `/migrate-db rollback` - Rollback database changes
- `/debug` - Systematic debugging approach

Remember: These commands are designed to make Living Tree development faster, more consistent, and safer across all environments!
