# Debug Summary - Local Development Setup Testing

## Issue

Testing the quickstart guide from `/docs/guides/local-development-setup.mdx` to verify the local development environment works correctly after fixing environment variable access patterns.

## Root Cause

1. **Environment Variable Access**: Fixed incorrect `env.server.*` and `env.client.*` patterns to direct `env.*` access
2. **PostgreSQL Version Incompatibility**: Supabase database initialized with PostgreSQL v15 but CLI now uses v17.4
3. **Missing Database Tables**: Fresh Supabase instance didn't have the `email_triage_results` table

## Fix

1. **Code Changes**:
   - Fixed 5 files to use correct environment variable access pattern
   - Removed console.log statements from production code
   - Added explicit TypeScript return types
   - Fixed linting warnings

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Stopped all conflicting services
   - Removed old PostgreSQL volume with incompatible version
   - Started fresh Supabase instance with PostgreSQL v17.4
   - Created migration for `email_triage_results` table

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend running at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend API running at http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Supabase running at http://localhost:54321
- ✅ All environment variable access patterns fixed
- ⚠️ Triage page still showing errors due to database table not being created properly

## Next Steps

The migration file was created but may not have been applied correctly. To complete the setup:

1. Manually apply the migration:

   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase Studio SQL Editor
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.email_triage_results (
       id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       email_id TEXT NOT NULL,
       subject TEXT,
       sender TEXT,
       snippet TEXT,
       priority_score INTEGER CHECK (priority_score >= 1 AND priority_score <= 5),
       urgency TEXT,
       action_needed TEXT,
       summary TEXT,
       analysis JSONB,
       triage_date TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
       created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
       updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

2. Or reset Supabase completely:
   ```bash
   npx supabase stop
   npx supabase db reset
   npx supabase start
   ```

## Prevention

- Always test with fresh Supabase instance after PostgreSQL updates
- Include database schema checks in development setup validation
- Add health check endpoints that verify database tables exist
