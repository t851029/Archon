```

## Implementation Blueprint

### Task 1: Create Core Quick-Win Agents (Day 1)

```bash
# Location: ~/.claude/agents/
# Pattern: Follow job-story-writer.md structure

1.1 Create quick-fix.md
    - Model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
    - Tools: Read, Edit, Grep
    - Test: echo "Fix typo in README" | claude --agent quick-fix

1.2 Create smart-reviewer.md
    - Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
    - Tools: Read, Grep, Bash(git diff*), Bash(pnpm lint*)
    - Test: claude --agent smart-reviewer

1.3 Create test-writer.md
    - Model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
    - Tools: Read, Write, Bash(pnpm test*)
    - Test: echo "Write tests for auth module" | claude --agent test-writer
```

### Task 2: Implement Cost Monitoring (Day 1)

```bash
# Location: ~/.claude/scripts/
# Executable: chmod +x monitor-costs.sh

2.1 Create monitor-costs.sh with:
    #!/bin/bash
    LOG_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
    echo "=== Cost Analysis for $LOG_DATE ==="
    grep "model:" ~/.claude/logs/${LOG_DATE}*.log | sort | uniq -c

2.2 Add to ~/.bashrc:
    export ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="claude-3-haiku-20240307"

2.3 Test monitoring:
    ./monitor-costs.sh
```

### Task 3: Create SDLC Commands (Day 2)

```bash
# Location: ~/.claude/commands/sdlc/
# Pattern: Follow existing command structure

3.1 Create analyze.md
    - Uses: requirements-analyst agent (to be created)
    - Validation: Check command appears in /sdlc:analyze

3.2 Create implement.md
    - Uses: sprint-orchestrator agent (to be created)
    - Validation: /sdlc:implement triggers agent

3.3 Create security-scan.md
    - Uses: security-guardian agent (to be created)
    - Validation: /sdlc:security-scan executes
```

### Task 4: Enhance Hooks Configuration (Day 3)

```bash
# Location: .claude/settings.json
# Backup first: cp .claude/settings.json .claude/settings.backup.json

4.1 Add SubagentStop hook for test-writer
4.2 Add PostToolUse hook for Python files
4.3 Test hooks trigger correctly
```

### Task 5: Create Remaining Agents (Week 2)

```bash
# Create in order of dependency

5.1 requirements-analyst.md (Sonnet model)
5.2 system-architect.md (Opus model - claude-opus-4-1-20250805)
5.3 frontend-developer.md (Sonnet model)
5.4 backend-developer.md (Sonnet model)
5.5 devops-engineer.md (Haiku model)
5.6 security-guardian.md (Sonnet model)
5.7 documentation-specialist.md (Haiku model)
5.8 performance-optimizer.md (Sonnet model)
5.9 git-specialist.md (Haiku model)
5.10 sprint-orchestrator.md (Opus model - claude-opus-4-1-20250805)
```

### Task 6: Integration Testing (Week 2)

```bash
6.1 Test individual agents
6.2 Test agent handoffs
6.3 Test command routing
6.4 Test hook automation
6.5 Verify cost reduction
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Syntax Validation (Immediate)

```bash
# After each agent creation
head -n 10 ~/.claude/agents/[agent-name].md  # Check frontmatter
claude --agent [agent-name] --help  # Verify agent loads
```

### Level 2: Functional Testing (After each component)

```bash
# Test agent functionality
echo "Test task" | claude --agent [agent-name]
# Check exit code: echo $?
```

### Level 3: Integration Testing (After related components)

```bash
# Test command invokes agent
/sdlc:analyze "test feature"
# Verify agent was called in logs
```

### Level 4: System Validation (End of each phase)

```bash
# Run cost analysis
~/.claude/scripts/monitor-costs.sh

# Check error rate
grep ERROR ~/.claude/logs/*.log | wc -l

# Verify all agents accessible
ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md | wc -l  # Should be 15 (3 existing + 12 new)
```

## Final Validation Checklist

### Pre-Implementation Validation

- [ ] Backup current settings: `cp -r ~/.claude ~/.claude.backup`
- [ ] Verify model availability: `claude /model`
- [ ] Check current command count: `ls ~/.claude/commands/*/*.md | wc -l`
- [ ] Document baseline metrics: API costs, task completion time

### Post-Implementation Validation

- [ ] All 12 new agents created: `ls ~/.claude/agents/*.md | wc -l` returns 15
- [ ] Cost monitoring works: `~/.claude/scripts/monitor-costs.sh` shows data
- [ ] SDLC commands available: `/sdlc:` autocompletes with 5 options
- [ ] Hooks trigger correctly: Edit a file and see validation output
- [ ] 50% cost reduction achieved: Compare before/after in monitor-costs.sh
- [ ] No regression in existing commands: Test 3 existing commands still work
- [ ] Agent handoffs work: `/sdlc:implement "test"` completes successfully
- [ ] Error rate acceptable: `grep ERROR ~/.claude/logs/*.log | wc -l` < 10

### Success Metrics Tracking

- [ ] Day 1: 3 agents operational, cost monitoring active
- [ ] Day 3: SDLC commands working, hooks enhanced
- [ ] Week 1: 50% cost reduction measured
- [ ] Week 2: All 12 agents deployed and tested
- [ ] Month 1: 70% automation achieved, metrics dashboard complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Procedures

```bash
# If issues arise, restore from backup
mv ~/.claude ~/.claude.failed
mv ~/.claude.backup ~/.claude
claude /config reload
```

### Known Risks and Mitigations

1. **Model unavailability**: Fall back to claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
2. **Hook conflicts**: Test hooks individually before combining
3. **Agent errors**: Each agent isolated, won't affect others
4. **Cost overrun**: Daily monitoring catches issues early

## Appendix: Agent Templates

### Quick-Fix Agent (Validated Working Template)

```markdown
---
name: quick-fix
description: Rapidly fixes simple bugs using efficient Haiku model
model: claude-3-haiku-20240307
tools: Read, Edit, Grep

You are a Quick Fix specialist for rapid issue resolution.

Scope:

- Typos and formatting
- Import statements
- Simple logic errors
- Variable naming

Process:

1. Identify exact issue
2. Make minimal atomic change
3. Verify fix works
