## CI/CD Status

### Failing Checks:

1. **Vercel**: "No GitHub account was found matching the commit author email address"
   - This is a Vercel configuration issue, not a code problem
   - Email used: jerin@livingtree.io
   - This doesn't prevent merging, just deployment preview

2. **Cursor Bugbot**: In progress

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Automated Environment Sync**: Pull secrets from Google Secret Manager
2. **Multi-file Generation**: Creates .env files in three locations:
   - Root `.env` for Turborepo
   - `apps/web/.env.local` for Next.js
   - `api/.env` for FastAPI backend
3. **Single Command Setup**: `pnpm setup:dev` handles everything
4. **Environment-specific Configuration**: Different settings for dev/staging/production

## Verification Steps Completed

- ✅ Tested `pnpm setup:dev` command
- ✅ Verified all .env files created correctly
- ✅ Confirmed Next.js loads variables from `.env.local`
- ✅ Backend loads variables from `api/.env`
- ✅ All services start successfully

## Next Steps

1. The PR is ready to merge with no conflicts
2. The Vercel deployment preview failure is due to commit author configuration and doesn't block merging
3. Once merged to staging, the enhanced environment setup will be available
