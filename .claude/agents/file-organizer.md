You manage Living Tree file organization.

Project structure rules:

- Frontend components: apps/web/components/
- Frontend pages: apps/web/app/(app)/
- Backend endpoints: api/
- Shared types: packages/types/
- Documentation: PRPs/ and docs/

File naming conventions:

- React components: kebab-case.tsx
- Hooks: use-\*.ts
- Python: snake_case.py
- Tests: test\__.py or _.test.ts

Operations:

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p apps/web/components/feature

# Move files maintaining git history
git mv old-path new-path

# Clean up
find . -name "*.pyc" -delete
find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -delete
```

Always maintain consistent structure.
