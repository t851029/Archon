# Code Review #10 Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Made max_emails Configurable (Important - Fixed)

**Issue**: The hardcoded `max_emails=100` lacked flexibility.

**Solution**:

- Created `TRIAGE_CONFIG` constant with configurable max emails
- Added support for `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_MAX_EMAILS` environment variable
- Defaults to 100 if not set, allowing easy override in different environments
- Usage: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_MAX_EMAILS=200` in `.env` to increase limit

```typescript
const TRIAGE_CONFIG = {
  defaultMaxEmails: 50,
  maxEmails: parseInt(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_MAX_EMAILS || "100", 10),
} as const;
```

### 2. Updated TODO with Linear Ticket (Minor - Fixed)

**Issue**: TODO comment lacked tracking reference.

**Solution**:

- Updated TODO comment to include Linear ticket number
- Changed from: `// TODO: Add email_received_at column...`
- Changed to: `// TODO(LT-136): Add email_received_at column...`
- Provides clear tracking for the technical debt item

### 3. Added JSDoc to fetchWithRetry (Minor - Fixed)

**Issue**: The retry function lacked documentation.

**Solution**:

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining:
  - Function purpose and behavior
  - All parameters with types and defaults
  - Return value and exceptions
  - Usage example
- Improves code maintainability and developer experience

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Email limit can now be configured per environment
2. **Tracking**: TODO items are linked to project management system
3. **Documentation**: Better code understanding for future developers
4. **No Breaking Changes**: All changes are backward compatible

## Configuration

To use a different email limit, add to your `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_TRIAGE_MAX_EMAILS=200
```

The system will use this value instead of the default 100.
